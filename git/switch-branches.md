# 💭 Switch Branches

1. Switch to a branch that you want

    ```bash
    dev@dev:~/your-project$ git switch [branch-name]
    ```

    <br />

    > **ℹ️ NOTE**
    >
    > Remember to replace `[branch-name]` with your branch name (e.g. develop).
    >
    > Example: `git switch develop`

2. To check in which branch you are in

    ```bash
    dev@dev:~/your-project$ git branch --show-current
    ```
