# ðŸ’­ Linux Go Installation

1. Go to the official Go website and its '[All releases](https://go.dev/dl/)' page. Copy the link address of the Linux Go package.

2. Download the file (replace `xx.xx` with the latest version):

    ```bash
    $ wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.xx.xx.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

3. Extract it to `/usr/local` using the following command:

    ```bash
    $ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.xx.xx.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

4. Update your shell config (`~/.bashrc`):

    ```bash
    $ sudo vim ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Add the following lines (adjust paths as needed):
    ```bash
    # If you have a mounted storage for Go projects, set GOPATH there.
    # Otherwise, default to $HOME/go.
    # export GOPATH=$HOME/go        # Fallback to home directory
    export GOPATH=/mnt/storage/go   # For mounted storage
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
    ```

5. Save the changes by sourcing the file using the following command:

    ```bash
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ```

6. Verify installation:

    ```bash
    $ go version
    $ go env      # Optional: shows Go environment settings
    ```
